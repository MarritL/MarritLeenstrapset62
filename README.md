# Vegetariano!
Final Project App for Minor Programming at the Universtiy of Amsterdam

## Introduction
Vegetariano! is a mobile application designed for new vegetarians. It can be difficult to start and commit to a vegetarian diet after many meat-eating years. You don't know what to cook and how to cook it and after a while, you might start to miss your hamburgers and chickenwings. Vegetariano! is helping users in this early stage of their vegetarianism by supplying them daily with new recipes. As well it helps keep users commited by keeping track of the user's runstreak and total vegetarian days. With this is calculates how many animals are saved and how many CO2-emision is avoided by the user. Users can furthermore relate to the Vegetariano! community and check how many people ate vegetarian at a day, as well as how many animal kills and CO2-emission is avoided by the community as a whole.
